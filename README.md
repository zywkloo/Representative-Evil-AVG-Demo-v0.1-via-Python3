This is a developing demo of AVG game for comp 1501.In this game, you need to find the 10 brides within 30 days. Each action will consume your time. 
		  
			
	Final plan:
	1)For every beginning of each day, NPCs are supposed move to the closed node on their motion list.
	2)You have 4 disctinct means to make the bride-candidates sign the contract with Archdemon Belial，
	which is your job as a bounty hunter.
	3)The hero have to use his Strength， Lore， Charm and of course， Money， to fulfill different 
	requests of the brides'.
	4) Within 30 days, please find as many available as you can before the Judgment Day.
    
 
However, due to heavy course load from 3rd-year courses, the game designer had to stop the project from then on.  :(
